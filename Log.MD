2019-03-27

- Minor Text Update

Version 0.77.00

- More 2e sphere updates

2019-03-26

- Integrated new new tp2 and ini

- The Hivekeeper bug is fixed.

- The Beast Lord, neé Shapeshifter, can now cast spells with Beast Claw active, and can shapeshift into a werewolf more often.

- Instead of getting shoehorned into the sphere system with a bunch of spells for free, Shamans now choose spells just as in the vanilla game - this can co-exist with the sphere system thanks to @kjeron's spell-learning UI mod.

- Spell selection at character generation is fixed, and now controlled by the sphere system code.

- The sphere system now fully supports alternate sphere definitions. (None are included yet - the 2E system in this package is unfinished, @Grammarsalad is working on it.)

- The "Incarnate of Mystra" is enabled, if anyone wants to try out the spontaneous-casting system (it's just like the Might & Guile bardic casting.)

- The "install sphere system only" option has been tested as rigorously as the "install everything" option
